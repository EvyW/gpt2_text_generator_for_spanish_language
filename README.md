# GPT2 text generator for spanish language

Disclaimer: This is not the official gpt2 implementation. You can find the original [here](https://github.com/openai/gpt-2)

Given a piece of text (in Spanish), this program generates text that is similar. For example, given the following text taken from one of Allan Poe's tales:

The text that is generated looks like this:

Note that the new functionality only translate any text given in english to spanish, meaning that there is no training with a corpus in spanish.
